# Random-Password-Generator
In today's digital age, security is a top concern for anyone who uses the internet, especially when it comes to protecting personal accounts. One of the simplest and most effective ways to secure your online accounts is by using a strong, unique password for each account. However, coming up with and remembering these complex passwords can be a challenge for many people.

To solve this problem, a random password generator can be a useful tool. A password generator is a program that creates a unique, random password for you to use on your accounts. The password is typically a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols, and can be customized to fit specific requirements, such as password length and complexity.

One such password generator is written in Python, a popular programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. This password generator program uses Python's built-in random module to create a password that is both unique and secure.

The program works by taking user input for the desired length and complexity of the password. It then generates a random string of characters that meets these requirements and displays it on the screen. This password can be copied and pasted into any account, ensuring that each account has a unique and strong password.

By using a random password generator, you can ensure that your accounts are secure and protected against hackers and identity theft. With this Python program, you can generate strong and unique passwords quickly and easily, allowing you to change your passwords frequently without any hassle.
